## Problem Statement 1 
Hand-written digits classification. The MNIST data set is a famous data set for multi-class classification, which can be downloaded here http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. In this problem you
will design a SGD algorithm for multi-class support vector machine with group-sparse regularization
that solves the following optimization problem
